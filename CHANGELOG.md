# Changelog

## 0.1.1

A pre-release, still not tested on hardware.

- Fix: writing an SD card or USB drive failed at once with "The writer could
  not be started. Node.util.isObject is not a function" on every system. The
  module that asks for administrator rights used functions that Electron's
  Node.js no longer has.

## 0.1.0

First version, a pre-release: not yet tested on hardware.

- Write Roxora images from the roxora-os/build releases to SD cards and USB
  drives, with the download checked against the release SHA-256 and the drive
  read back and compared with it.
- Write a board's eMMC or SPI NOR over USB in Maskrom mode, using
  rkdeveloptool built for WebAssembly as in edk2-webflash, with the same
  read-back check.
- System disks are never offered as targets.
- Checks for a new version at most once a day; can be turned off.
- The Maskrom loader is not shipped: the first Maskrom write builds it from
  Rockchip's rkbin files at a pinned commit, each checked against its SHA-256.
- Packages for Windows (x64), macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux
  (AppImage, .deb, .rpm; x86_64 and arm64). Windows builds are not signed yet;
  macOS builds are ad-hoc signed.
